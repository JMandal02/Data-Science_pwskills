        "**1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which contain data and code: data in the form of fields (attributes), and code in the form of procedures (methods). It promotes code reuse and modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - An object is an instance of a class. It holds actual data and can use the class’s methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Abstraction** hides implementation details and shows only the functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Encapsulation** hides data by wrapping it inside classes and restricting direct access using access modifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods like ``__init__ ``, ``__str__``, ``__repr__``, used for operator overloading and object lifecycle management.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**\n",
        "  - Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire attributes and methods from another class (parent), promoting code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "  - Polymorphism means the same method can behave differently based on the object calling it, either via method overriding or overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "  - Encapsulation is achieved using private (``__var``) or protected (``_var``) access modifiers and providing getter/setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "  - A constructor is a special method named ``__init__`` that gets called automatically when an object is instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Class method uses ``@classmethod`` and takes ``cls`` as the first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Static method uses ``@staticmethod`` and takes no implicit first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "  - Python does not support traditional method overloading. It can be simulated using default arguments or ``*args``.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Method overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "  - ``@property`` allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, often used for getters/setters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "  - It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class, enabling code reusability and flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "**15. What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "  - An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods defined using the abc module.\n",
        "\n",
        "**16. What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Modularity\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Extensibility\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Maintainability\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Real-world modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "**17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Class variable is shared among all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Instance variable is unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "**18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "  - It allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, potentially leading to method resolution conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**19. Explain the purpose of `` __str__`` and ``__repr__`` methods in Python.**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ``__str__``: Returns a user-friendly string representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ``__repr__``: Returns an unambiguous string (for developers).\n",
        "\n",
        "**20. What is the significance of the ``super()`` function in Python?**\n",
        "  - ``super()`` is used to call a method from the parent class, especially useful in method overriding.\n"

        "**21. What is the significance of the`` __del__`` method in Python?**\n",

        "\n",
        "**22. What is the difference between ``@staticmethod`` and ``@classmethod`` in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ``@staticmethod:`` Doesn’t access class or instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ``@classmethod:`` Takes class ``(cls)`` as its first argument and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "**23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In Python, child classes can override parent methods. When the method is called on an object, the version in the actual object's class is executed.\n",
