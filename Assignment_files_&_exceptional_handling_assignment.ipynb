        "**1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Compiled languages (e.g., C, C++) translate source code into machine code before execution, making them faster at runtime but requiring recompilation after changes.\n",
        "Interpreted languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) execute code line-by-line through an interpreter, making development easier but generally slower.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Exception handling is the process of catching and managing runtime errors to prevent program crashes. It is implemented using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The finally block executes regardless of whether an exception occurred, typically used to close files, release resources, or clean up after execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What is logging in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Logging is the process of recording events during program execution using the logging module. It helps track program flow, errors, and debugging information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What is the significance of the ``__del__`` method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ``__del__`` is a destructor method in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. Itâ€™s used for cleanup tasks like releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. What is the difference between ``import`` and ``from ... import`` in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ``import module``: Imports the whole module and requires prefixing functions with the module name.\n",
        "  - ``from module import function``: Imports specific functions or variables directly, without the module prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - You can use multiple except blocks or a tuple of exceptions:\n",
        "        try:\n",
        "            risky_operation()\n",
        "        except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n",
        "            print(e)\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It ensures that files are properly closed after operations, even if exceptions occur, improving resource management.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Multithreading:** Multiple threads within the same process share memory space; best for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
        "  - **Multiprocessing:** Multiple processes run independently with separate memory spaces; best for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Records events and errors for debugging\n",
        "  - Adjustable verbosity levels\n",
        "  - Can log to files or remote servers\n",
        "  - Provides timestamps and message formatting\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What is memory management in Python**?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Memory management in Python involves allocating and freeing memory automatically through a built-in garbage collector, while the developer can manage references and data structures efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Wrap risky code inside a try block\n",
        "  2. Catch exceptions with except blocks\n",
        "  3. Optionally use an else block for code that runs if no exceptions occur\n",
        "  4. Use finally to run cleanup code\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It ensures optimal use of available memory, prevents memory leaks, improves performance, and avoids crashes due to excessive memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - try: Contains code that may raise an exception.\n",
        "  - except: Catches and handles exceptions, preventing the program from terminating unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Python uses reference counting to track object usage and a cyclic garbage collector to remove unused objects, freeing up memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block, making it useful for code that should execute only when everything goes smoothly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**17. What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- ``DEBUG``: Detailed information for diagnosing problems\n",

        "- ``WARNING``: Potential issues that are not errors\n",
        "- ``ERROR``: Serious issues causing part of the program to fail\n",
        "- ``CRITICAL``: Severe errors that may stop the program\n",
        "\n",
        "**18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- ``os.fork()``: Works only on Unix-like systems, creates a new process by duplicating the current one.\n",
        "- ``multiprocessing``: Cross-platform module that creates processes with better control and features like process pools.\n",
        "\n",
        "**19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Closing a file releases system resources, ensures data is written to disk, and prevents file corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "**20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- ``read()``: Reads the entire file or a specified number of characters at once.\n",
        "- ``readline()``: Reads one line at a time, useful for large files.\n",
        "\n",
        "**21. What is the logging module in Python used for?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - he logging module provides a flexible way to record program messages with different severity levels, output destinations, and formats.\n",
        "\n",
        "**22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - You can use the raise statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "        raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n",
        "\n",
        "**25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n",
